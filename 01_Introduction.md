# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing you to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is the foundation of web development and is essential for creating websites and web applications.

## Key Features of HTML

- **Elements and Tags**: HTML uses elements and tags to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., `<tagname>`.
- **Attributes**: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as `id`, `class`, `src`, and `href`.
- **Document Structure**: An HTML document has a specific structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` helps improve the readability and accessibility of the webpage.
